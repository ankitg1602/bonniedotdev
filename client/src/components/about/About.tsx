        Bonnie&apos;s wide-ranging past positions include education programs at a planetarium,
        high school physics teacher, coding boot camp instructor, and developer
        infrastructure engineer test frameworks. All of her favorite jobs have involved explaining
        thorny technical concepts in some form, and she&apos;s pleased as punch to
        be producing online content full-time. She feels weird writing about herself
        in the third person.
